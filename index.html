    <h1>Jollof Rice</h1>
    Jollof rice is a vibrant, one-pot West African dish made with long-grain rice, tomatoes, onions, and a blend of spices like thyme, curry, and scotch bonnet peppers. Often cooked with vegetables, meat, or fish, it has a rich, spicy flavor and bright red-orange color from tomato paste or stew. Popular in countries like Nigeria, Ghana, and Senegal, it’s a staple at celebrations and gatherings, with regional variations sparking <i>friendly</i> debates over the best recipe.

        <li>Rice: 2 cups long-grain parboiled rice (e.g., Uncle Ben’s or Golden Sella)</li>
        <li>Tomatoes: 4–5 medium fresh tomatoes or 1 can (14 oz) tomato puree</li>
        <li>Tomato Paste: 2–3 tablespoons</li>
        <li>Onions: 1 large onion, finely chopped</li>
        <li>Red Bell Pepper: 1–2, blended or finely chopped</li>
        <li>Scotch Bonnet Peppers: 1–2 (adjust for spice preference), blended or finely chopped</li>
        <li>Vegetable Oil: ¼–½ cup (or palm oil for traditional flavor)</li>
        <li>Garlic: 2–3 cloves, minced (optional)</li>
        <li>Ginger: 1-inch piece, grated (optional)</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon thyme</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon curry powder</li>
        <li>1–2 bay leaves</li>
        <li>Stock Cubes: 2–3 (e.g., Maggi or Knorr) or 1–2 teaspoons seasoning powder</li>
        <li>Chicken or Vegetable Stock: 3–4 cups (or water)</li>
        <li>Protein (optional): 1 lb chicken, beef, fish, or shrimp, pre-cooked or fried</li>

        <h2>Instructions</h2>
        <ol>
        <li>Heat ¼–½ cup vegetable oil (or palm oil) in a large pot over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Add chopped onions and sauté until translucent, about 3–4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Stir in 2–3 tablespoons tomato paste and cook for 2–3 minutes, stirring to prevent burning.</li>
        <li>Add the blended tomato-pepper puree, garlic, and ginger (if using). Cook for 10–15 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mixture thickens and the oil begins to separate (the “stew” base).</li>
        <li>Add 1 teaspoon thyme, 1 teaspoon curry powder, 1–2 bay leaves, 1 teaspoon smoked paprika (optional), and 2–3 stock cubes (or seasoning powder). Stir well.</li>
        <li>Adjust with salt to taste. Cook for another 2–3 minutes to blend flavors.</li>
        <li>Add the rinsed rice to the pot, stirring to coat it evenly with the tomato base.</li>
        <li>Pour in 3–4 cups of chicken/vegetable stock or water (ensure liquid just covers the rice). Stir gently.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Cover the pot with a tight-fitting lid (use foil if needed to trap steam) and simmer for 20–30 minutes. Check occasionally; add a little more liquid if the rice is still hard.</li>
        <li>If using vegetables (e.g., carrots, peas, or green beans), stir them in about 10 minutes before the rice is fully cooked.</li>
        <li>Add pre-cooked protein (chicken, beef, shrimp, or fish) at this stage, nestling it into the rice to warm through.</li>
        <li>Taste and adjust seasoning if needed. Check rice for doneness; it should be soft but not mushy.</li>
        <li>If you prefer the smoky “party jollof” flavor, let the rice slightly “burn” at the bottom (low heat, 2–3 minutes, without stirring).</li>
        <li>Remove from heat, fluff the rice with a fork, and discard bay leaves.</li>
        <li>Serve hot with a side of fried plantain, salad, or coleslaw.</li>
        </ol>

    <!-- Tips on making the dish -->
    <P>
        <h3><u>Tips</u></h3>
        For best results, use a heavy-bottomed pot to prevent burning, and avoid stirring too much during cooking to keep the rice grains intact. Cooking times may vary depending on rice type and heat level.
